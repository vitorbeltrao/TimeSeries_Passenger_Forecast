## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using a time series dataset to forecast the number of passengers in an air company and show how can deep learning models can be very powerful in these kind of problems.

Soon, I will be putting here a file with the deployment of this model!

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to this project and the dataset.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://pandascouple.medium.com/s%C3%A9ries-temporais-previs%C3%B5es-utilizando-redes-neurais-3593f6f988bb).
